# JFlow
because the official portal is their strongest weapon against our sanity.

## ✨ features (no cap)
- **Offline First**: The Wi-Fi is down? Skill issue? Nah. JFlow caches everything. Check your attendance while touching grass.
- **Attendance + Timetable**: The unified view you didn't know you needed. See where you need to be and if you can afford to skip it in one glance.
- **Privacy**: We don't want your data. It stays on your device.

## 🚀 roadmap (we're so back)
- **Auto-magic Timetable Parsing**: Type schedule manually? In 2026? Lmao no. Coming soon.
- **Community Support**: Trauma bonding with your batchmates.

## 📦 how to use
1. Clone this repo.
2. `npm install` (or whatever package manager you simp for).
3. `npm run dev`.
4. dissociate.

## ⚠️ disclaimer
Not liable for the panic attacks caused by viewing your 60% attendance. That's between you and the teacher.
